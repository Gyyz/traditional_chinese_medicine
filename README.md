## Project Overview

This project aims to improve the performance of LLMs on [Your Specific Task/Domain, e.g., question answering about historical events, generating creative writing in a specific style, summarizing medical documents]. We achieve this by:

1.  **Collecting a relevant dataset:** Gathering data that is specific to the target task.
2.  **Cleaning and preprocessing the data:** Ensuring the data is in a format suitable for LLM fine-tuning.
3.  **Fine-tuning LLMs using various methods:** Experimenting with different techniques to optimize performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* [List required Python libraries, e.g., `transformers`, `datasets`, `torch`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`]
* [Specify any required cloud platforms or hardware, e.g., access to a GPU, Hugging Face account]

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [repository directory]
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # create a requirements.txt file listing your dependencies.
    ```

## Data Collection

* [Describe the source of your data, e.g., web scraping, APIs, existing datasets].
* [Explain the process of collecting the data, including any scripts or tools used].
* [Mention the size and format of the collected data].
* (Optional) provide a sample of your collected data.

## Data Cleaning

* [Describe the steps taken to clean and preprocess the data, e.g., removing duplicates, handling missing values, tokenization].
* [Explain any specific data transformations or augmentations performed].
* [Mention any libraries or tools used for data cleaning].
* (Optional) provide code snippets of cleaning process.

## Fine-Tuning Methods

The following fine-tuning methods have been implemented:

* **Full Fine-Tuning:** [Brief description of full fine-tuning].
* **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):**
    * **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):** [Brief description of LoRA].
    * **[Other PEFT methods if applicable]**
* **[Other fine-tuning methods if applicable, e.g., prompt tuning]**

[Provide links to relevant research papers or documentation for each method].

## Usage

1.  **Prepare the dataset:**
    * Place your cleaned data in the `data/` directory.
    * [Explain the expected format of the dataset].

2.  **Run the fine-tuning scripts:**

    ```bash
    python fine_tune_full.py --model_name [model name] --dataset_path data/your_dataset.jsonl --output_dir checkpoints/full_fine_tune
    python fine_tune_lora.py --model_name [model name] --dataset_path data/your_dataset.jsonl --output_dir checkpoints/lora_fine_tune
    # Add other fine-tuning commands here
    ```

3.  **Evaluate the fine-tuned models:**

    ```bash
    python evaluate.py --model_path checkpoints/full_fine_tune --dataset_path data/test_dataset.jsonl
    ```

[Replace placeholders with your actual file names, model names, and paths].

## Results

[Summarize the results of your fine-tuning experiments, including metrics such as accuracy, BLEU score, or other relevant measures].

[Include tables or graphs to visualize the performance of different fine-tuning methods].

[Discuss any insights or observations gained from the experiments].
